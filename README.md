<b>Some of my Piet Algorithms/Artworks</b>

<BR>


These works are actually simple algorithms written in the PIET programming language

https://esolangs.org/wiki/Piet

PIET is a language that takes advantage of the difference in color and size between the various pixels to perform various functions that are interpreted by a shell (also online)
It is therefore possible to create real works of art that perform the chosen commands ...

These are some of my most successful examples!

To test the algorithms go here:
https://www.bertnase.de/npiet/npiet-execute.php
then upload the chosen work in png format
and click on <b>"upload and execute"</b> or <b>"upload and ask about"</b> input as appropriate...
